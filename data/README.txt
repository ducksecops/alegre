Put models here. The one included in the repo is very small and only for testing purposes. You can download the Google one from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit, Glove ones from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ (and use the script here to convert to Gensim format) or other models from the list at https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api#where-to-get-a-pretrained-models.
