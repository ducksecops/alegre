Pretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film.
Off to Miami!
A slew of movie trailers aired during Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday. Here are all of the biggies, starring all the ‘raptor, race-cars, and reckless teddy bears you could ever want:
As reported, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady makes an appropriately raunchy cameo in the new TV spot for the comedy sequel. When Ted and Tami-Lynn decide they want a baby, they need to find a superstar sperm donor. Who better than one of the most successful QBs of all time? But when Ted and John try to swipe Brady's, um, DNA, their plan goes as well as you might guess. On the plus side, Ted gets to experience one of Brady's perfect spirals first-hand.
Release date: June 26
Jurassic World
The second Jurassic World trailer has a few by-now-familiar elements — dig that shark-bait feeding-frenzy again! — but also features even more glimpses of the movie's dynamic dinos: We see Chris Pratt try to tame a trio of velociraptors ("Eyes on me!" he pleads, though we're guessing he won't have a hard time getting their attention). We also watch a crew of pterodactyls swoop down and grab some poor park-goer. But the big reveal is the new hybrid-dino, the Indominus Rex, which has big teeth, big feet, and a big appetite for lowly park employees.
Release date: June 13
Furious"Looks like the sins of London followed us home," says Dom (Vin Diesel) after he just barely escapes an exploding house in an early scene. The new clip fills in some more of the plot of the high-octane sequel, including just how serious Jason Statham's villain is about delivering vengeance on our beloved crew.
Release date: April 3

At one point last year, the top money-making movies were ALL but one non-original. They were franchise installments, or sequels, they were rebootings or reimaginings; there were TV remakes, but DAMN few original ideas in film. Fast & Furious and Jurassic Park? Gimme a break!Reply0 0

List of languages by number of native speakers
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For various estimates of the total speakers of the top languages, see List of languages by total number of speakers.
It has been suggested that this article be merged into List of languages by total number of speakers. (Discuss) Proposed since August 2015.

Current distribution of human language families

Half of the world's population speaks the 13 most populous languages. The following table lists the languages of the world with the largest number of native speakers as estimated by the Swedish Nationalencyklopedin (2007, 2010).

Since the distinction of language and dialect is often arbitrary, some mutually intelligible idioms with separate national standards or self-identification have been unified, including Indonesian and Malay; Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian; etc., but not Standard Hindi and Urdu.

For a list of languages with the smallest numbers of native speakers, see Lists of endangered languages.

The following table contains the top 100 languages by estimated number of speakers in the 2007 edition of Nationalencyklopedin. As census methods in different countries vary to a considerable extent, and some countries do not record language in their censuses, any list of languages by native speakers, or total speakers, is based on estimates. Updated estimates from 2010 are also provided.[1]

Hindustani has been divided into the sociolinguistic units of Hindi and Urdu, while a number of northern Indian languages have been partially merged into "Hindi", reflecting self-identity reported in the Indian census. This Hindi is thus not a language in the linguistic sense.

The top eleven languages have additional figures from the 2010 edition of the Nationalencyklopedin. Numbers above 95 million are rounded off to the nearest 5 million.
