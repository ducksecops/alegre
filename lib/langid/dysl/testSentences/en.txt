"85% chance of rain in the next 15 minutes." "93% chance of rain in the next 15 minutes." Gee, weather app, whatever would I do without you?
"Even that Greedo shot first?"
"Fixed" my neighbour's wireless router by telling her to turn it off and back on. I am a tech herofraud.
"It's true. All of it."
"No, that part's bullshit."
"There are stories about what happened."

@_polymetis_ Glad to hear it. There were three stations at mine. I was lucky to have the short line number.
@_polymetis_ God forbid. :) (I ordered the one with rubber ducks on it.)
@_polymetis_ There's one key one that's missing yet. :)
@35mmmonkey The Holy Grail. :)
@abeard07 @kwhumane Congrats! Handsome gent.
@becubed Walkers keep left, standees keep right, deciders pick which you're going to be. :)
@beerboozebites @beausallnatural @beerlybrian Hah! We were having exactly that discussion this morning. (Extra points for Simpsons ref.)
@berryonline @sipbiteelmira @ohlrangers @craiger_c @davejaworsky I would like to see a between periods game of mayoral one-on-one. :)
@bithoundio @pj_lowe Happy Birthday!
@bodil @_polymetis_ You know you've got it going on when you could still look that regal sitting in a (really big) cardboard box.
@bohemiangirl @pavanrajam @rands Or "Yay, Process!" if you're not comfortable with that level of overt enthusiasm…
@bruce_arthur I think we like Shane Koyczan okay.
@brundle_fly Clearly it's time to embark on a crime spree before they get their height-measuring act together.
@brundle_fly Women! People who aren't white! Women who aren't white! People who do actual science, economics, etc.! *clutches pearls*
@cardamomaddict Can't think of any pork or scone that should be grey…
@cardamomaddict Slightly overcooked…
@cardamomaddict True, or a weird greyish green.
@cdutson I have a 6S which was updated with the latest OS version yesterday. Whadda you have?
@cdutson No, I've used it plugged in, with the aux in the car, and entirely unplugged.
@cdutson Say, "Hey Siri". Ask question. Siri talks back. Perhaps Siri does not love you?
@cdutson So an S change, maybe? The differences from my 4S are… significant. :)
@chadtatro Took me a minute to figure out what you were talking about. :)
@charsbooks @daejin_v2 @lianakreamer I might need a future #PubLit to do that, too. (I waited a decade to read Shake Hands w/ the Devil…)
@charsbooks @lianakreamer @daejin_v2 @kitchlibrary Haven't read it yet. From what I've heard I need to prepare myself. :)
@charsbooks @lianakreamer @daejin_v2 @kitchlibrary If you get a good book discussion going, you'll forget all about social media-ing it. :)
@cmclymer Not to be done still. They've all be sworn in now. :)
@cmlplunkett @jfedor Obviously, it's going to here: http://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/SausageFest.asp …
@cmlplunkett Yeah, people have been telling me their stories all day. Should have a round table with whiskey as therapy. :)
@craighaney Spanish Inquisition birthday cake… Unexpected! :)
@cristenconger @business Yeah, because feminism doesn't have anything more important to "revile" or focus attention on…
@daejin_v2 @kitchlibrary \m/ Going to try to make it down, and chat with you and @lianakreamer as well.
@daejin_v2 @kitchlibrary At the Firkin as previously?
@daejin_v2 The problem with batshit's entertainment value is it's temporary. It gets very tiresome quickly.
@daejin_v2 True. Makes digestion easier than the unfiltered pipeline.
@danphillipskw Least it's not TPS Weekly. :)
@davejaworsky I hope you get to put up your feet with a pint at some point today. :)
@davejaworsky Need to get a shot like that over Waterloo Park. It's lovely. And they put in the barrels of mums this morning. :)
@dch__ @_polymetis_ Would if I could. Took me a year to get ONE. I think K said new ones are imminent, though.
@dch__ But I did get wolfhound belly rub time as compensation.
@dch__ If you have to actually lay hands on the hardware, something is very wrong.
@dch__ She asked me when we were at dog play group, so I fixed it without even entering her apartment. Also, *I'm* the baker. :)
@dragonskitchen I'll share with Mom. I can't eat a whole batch, and it'll keep me in the will. :)
@DrewRipley made an installation of monkeys at #MakerExpo. Be still my heart. :D
